  0: "Lack of 1 — Lack of leadership qualities. A person is dependent on the opinions of others and tends to shift responsibility.",
  1: '1 — "Egoist" — often a loner, unwilling to obey someone else’s will. Can be conflict-prone and argue for the sake of arguing, just to prove they can stand their ground. Tends to make decisions for personal gain. Needs to learn diplomacy throughout life.',
  2: "11 — Balanced character. Willpower is shown at the right time. Such a person can stand up for themselves without putting excessive pressure on others. Gets along well in a team.",
  3: "111 — “Golden mean” — this type of character is so called because it knows how to get along with all the others. They will correctly dominate a weaker person, and skillfully adapt under a stronger one, sometimes even arguing on equal terms. However, they often show themselves as very conflict-prone, challenging other leaders and society.",
  4: "1111 — Excessively tough character, prone to dictatorship. Used to controlling and managing, does not tolerate objections. Important to develop tolerance and respect for others’ boundaries.",
  5: "11111+ —“Dictator” — a restless, often aggressive and self-confident leader. They have a vital need for power, for organizing and managing others. Therefore, they are not afraid of conflicts and sometimes even provoke them, knowing they will win. They do not accept other points of view. Most of the wealthiest and most influential people in politics, business, the military sphere, and sports have the character type 1111 or 11111. Examples: Donald Trump, Barack Obama."

      0: "Lack of 2 — Lack of vital energy. A person quickly gets tired, may suffer from apathy, has difficulty mobilizing inner resources. Needs to learn how to manage energy carefully.",
      1: "2 — “Average energy” — the basic battery is only enough to handle the essentials. Large groups, audiences, and noisy parties are exhausting. Multi-day hikes and monotonous work fall into the same category. However, moderate exercise, fitness, yoga, or at the very least, walks and proper sleep are vital.",
      2: "22 — “Good energy” — any everyday tasks or short-term acts of willpower are within reach. With such energy, one can engage in social work, perform in front of an audience, be a musician or an athlete. But without fanaticism, otherwise there is a risk of burnout. Starting from 22, a person is even capable of sharing energy with others.”",
      3: "222 — “Impulsive energy” — in emergency situations, this person is capable of a powerful breakthrough or super-effort. But there can also be sudden drops to zero. Such a person, by their mere presence, can improve the condition of the sick or inspire hope in the hopelessly desperate. These people often become outstanding public figures, musicians, business coaches, and motivators. The danger is that they attract energy vampires like a magnet, especially of the opposite sex.",
      4: "2222 — “Impulsive energy” — in emergency moments, a person is capable of a powerful breakthrough or super-effort. But sudden drops down to zero also occur. Such a person can improve the condition of a sick person or inspire optimism in someone hopelessly desperate just by their presence. These people can become outstanding public figures, musicians, business coaches, and motivators. The danger is that they attract energy vampires like a magnet, especially of the opposite sex.",
      5: "22222+ —“Energy goes off the scale” — natural abilities to influence others, practice extrasensory perception, and healing can easily turn into a powerful flow of negative energy if the person does not know how to manage their gift. People around may even be afraid of such a character, whose mere glance feels like lightning and whose harsh word lays a curse. Yet at the same time, in a calm environment, this person remains charismatic and attractive. But only a few can truly handle them."

      0: "Lack of 3 — “No interest in knowledge” — there is no inclination toward understanding exact sciences, complex concepts, accumulating knowledge, or inventiveness. Nor is there a stable interest in anything of that kind. No problem — it simply means your path lies elsewhere.”",
      1: "3 — “Basic interest” — a level sufficient for a superficial grasp of exact sciences, technology, algorithms, and the systematization of knowledge. There are some inclinations toward inventiveness, creativity, and originality.”",
      2: "33 — “Advanced abilities” — with such potential, one can, if desired, deeply master exact sciences, technology, algorithms, or a system of knowledge. Alternatively, they may pursue art and create novels, music, or films. Even simple imagination can enable such a person to generate original ideas. However, self-realization along this path requires significant effort and skill development.",
      3: "333 — “Impulsive scientist and creator” — has serious potential to master any exact science, technology, algorithm, or system of knowledge, and to make a name in creative fields. In addition, they are also a dreamer and experimenter — this is what distinguishes them from 33 and 3. Dangers: an overly broad outlook, often an overactive imagination, and scattering of interests, with an inability to concentrate on something that requires deep immersion. Examples: Mark Zuckerberg, Steven Spielberg, Andrei Konchalovsky, Nicholas Roerich, Lionel Messi.",
      4: "3333 — “Scientist and inventor” — one of the rarest signs of our age. This is the potential of a true scientist, inventor, and creator. And it is not just someone who studies theory deeper than others, but someone capable of diving into a subject so profoundly that they return with a real discovery. To others, this person seems not of this world and is often misunderstood. This is due to their ability to think in new paradigms. Sadly, it is not always in their power to bring their ideas to life — ideas that could change the world often remain collecting dust in a drawer. Such a person needs to do a lot of work on themselves, and parents of such a child must give them space for creativity, imagination, and passions.",
      5: "33333+ — overcontrol, inability to relax."

    levels: {
      0: "Lack of 4 — “Low health reserve” — health is weak and should not be subjected to excessive strain. Fitness, yoga, proper nutrition, and prevention are the best allies. Such a person should not rely too much on appearance and beauty. It is better to pay attention to other strong qualities and focus on them in the search for self-realization.”",
      1: "4 — “Basic reserve of health and beauty” — usually one four goes either into health or into beauty. Therefore, if your reflection in the mirror looks good and you attract attention from others, pay attention to possible hidden ailments — it is important to detect them in time. If health is good, then appearance will not be a problem either.",
      2: "44 — “Decent health and beauty” — the quality is within the norm, but in practice usually one of the two is more developed — either health or beauty. Overall, health with 44 allows one to endure illnesses more easily and recover faster. And a pair of fours makes the appearance more harmonious and attractive in the eyes of the opposite sex, although the person themselves may not notice it. There are inclinations for sports or work connected with physical appearance. Physical exercises, fitness, and a healthy lifestyle will bring very good results for such people. But it is not worth abandoning health maintenance entirely, relying only on innate potential.",
      3: "444 — “Health or beauty?” — three fours are usually divided between health and beauty, though sometimes they lean entirely toward one. Outwardly, such a person often appears harmoniously built and attractive. They may use their qualities to become a professional athlete, actor, or model. In old age, they are capable of maintaining a clear mind and good activity. However, they should avoid being overly self-confident. Bearers of 444 tend to overestimate the physical side of their personality. On the negative side, like all triple energies, they may experience both sudden bursts and prolonged declines.",
      4: "4444 — “High health and beauty” — health and the body of a professional athlete, actor, or model by nature. If they do not waste their natural gifts, they will often remain the same even into old age. Usually, fours go either into health or into appearance. Therefore, super health and extraordinary beauty rarely combine in one person. But one of these qualities in the bearer of 4444 will definitely help in life, and it is worth making it their focus.",
      5: "44444+ — strong health reserve, sometimes leading to overconfidence."

      0: "Lack of 5 — “Logic is not your strong point.” This is a trait of dreamers who live with their heads in the clouds. They struggle to follow long chains of facts or reasoning and can be easily confused, often stumbling over the same mistakes. They are more emotional than rational. However, with time, they can achieve growth and development.",
      1: "5 — “Inclinations of logic” — logic is present in the person. If they do not grasp something on the first try, they will definitely figure it out with a calculator and paper. Quantum physics is unlikely to be within their reach, but it should be enough for basic everyday tasks.”",
      2: "55 — “Normal logic” — logic allows such a person to be a good analyst or programmer. And thanks to intuitive inclinations as well, they could, for example, solve complex crimes as an investigator. This person is capable of building a profitable business in almost any field, as they are guided by key indicators rather than secondary factors.",
      3: "555 — “Irrational logic” — logic is developed, but there are also flashes of all-encompassing super-logic or intuition. This especially happens in critical situations and under very tight deadlines for making decisions. At such moments, the person seems to rapidly see all steps and stages ahead. Learning to trust their intuition in these moments is the key to their success. In ordinary situations, this is a person capable of calculating their actions well and evaluating the benefits from them.”",
      4: "5555 — “Strong logic and intuition” — it seems that such a person receives answers to all questions as if from above. In reality, this is the result of a special ability to perceive, structure, and process large amounts of information. Because of this, predictions about the outcomes of certain events made by a 5555 bearer often turn out to be close to reality. Some of the best areas to apply this person’s talent are business, analytics, finance, and programming.",
      5: "55555+ — “Brilliant logic and the gift of foresight” — logic and the intuitive channel are at their peak, which to some extent suppresses emotionality. From this stage, the gift of foresight begins to manifest. Sometimes it seems that such a person looks beyond time and space. In reality, they are simply capable of processing in their mind such an enormous number of facts, events, and figures that most cannot even imagine. Many consider them a ‘human computer’."

In fact, such people usually don’t favor these fields themselves. Manual labor is not their strength.",
      1: "6 — “Inclinations of craftsmanship” — depending on their mood, a person can cope quite well with any work that requires diligence, accuracy, and process technique. Of course, they will not immediately become a jeweler, but whether it is building a house, doing repairs, or something that does not demand highly sophisticated skills, they are likely to succeed. And in the process, they may also refine their abilities.”",
      2: "66 — “Golden hands” — with constant improvement of their skills, a person can achieve mastery in any work that requires diligence, accuracy, and adherence to process techniques. But they will have to work hard to become a true master of their craft.",
      3: "666 — “Master of the craft” — such a person can skillfully do their work, mesmerizing others with the very process. They will inevitably achieve success if they have spent enough time honing their skills. For them, it is a matter of technique. It is also said that people with this sign should beware of others who have more sixes in their square: a master of a higher level always wins. And this can apply to any field — from laying tiles, photography, and up to jewelry making or boxing.",
      4: "6666 — “Hero of labor and master of their craft” — and they are literally born this way. For such a person, the main thing is to find a field where it is interesting to apply effort and improve. As a result of development, everything they take on becomes a true masterpiece. Those around them admire, respect, and envy them. One nuance: the highest level of mastery is usually not understood by everyone, and true admiration is accessible only to real connoisseurs.",

      0: "Lack of 7 — “Does not reach for the stars” — everything must be achieved on their own, through many attempts, without expecting sudden success. But let’s agree: achieving honest success through one’s own work and gaining accidental success by fortune’s will are two different things. Therefore, they should look to their other strengths and realize themselves by developing those.”",
      1: "7 — “With a life talisman” — of course, one seven does not guarantee hitting the jackpot at a casino on the first bet, but it will protect from minor troubles and sometimes help catch the departing train at the very last moment.",
      2: "77 — “Lucky one” — if you are not that proverbial “rolling stone,” fate will help you be in the right place at the right time. Sometimes it literally steers you away from troubles and wrong decisions. With such people, it often happens that after a series of successes they become overly self-confident, believing that luck will always be on their side without any effort. But not so: at that very moment, fortune loves to give arrogant lucky ones a sharp wake-up call.",
      3: "777 — “Three sevens” — a sign of major success and full ownership of one’s destiny. But great success can only be achieved after overcoming equally serious trials as a test. There is one problem for a person with this sign: exactly what they desire comes true. As soon as their thoughts turn negative and their self-belief disappears, the result follows immediately. Example: Arnold Schwarzenegger.”",
      4: "7777 — “Messiah” — the sign of luck turns into higher protection. But it is not given for winning at a casino. Such a person can lead others out of any catastrophe, and even seas will part before them. Being a savior is their life’s purpose. The danger, however, is that many people with this sign die absurdly, selflessly acting in critical situations.",
      5: "77777+ — “Creator of destiny” — of their own and of those whose lives they touch. Such a person no longer lives for themselves but in the name of saving the world. Their task is not to waste energy on trifles, but to act on a large scale, setting great goals. If these goals are beneficial for society, they will inevitably find success in achieving them."

      1: "8 — “Sense of duty and order in moderation” — such people usually do not avoid responsibilities toward their loved ones and friends. But nothing beyond that. Their initiative to give something to others or to society is low. At least, they do not forget those who are close. Their systematic view is at a basic level.”",
      2: "88 — “Duty to society and a systematic outlook” — usually people with well-developed social orientation, strong communication skills, and a systematic view. If this is nurtured from childhood, they positively realize themselves in social activities, finding joy in giving themselves to others — but without fanaticism.",
      3: "888 — “Truth-teller” — for them, the drive to express themselves and their ideas (naturally, “right” and “good” from their point of view) to society is often placed above their own or their family’s interests. And, of course, all of this is supposedly done for the public good. In general, social orientation in such people can sometimes go off the scale. And sometimes, strangely enough from the outside, such people may experience periods of isolation — until the moment when they once again strongly crave an active social life.",
      4: "8888 — “Parapsychologist” — a rarest sign of our time, indicating the presence of parapsychological abilities in a person, allowing them to influence the masses. These abilities can be used both for good and for harm. The development of these special abilities and their guidance in a positive direction should be carried out through finding a mentor and working with them.",

Such people often get lost in unfamiliar places or forget where they were going. On the other hand, the absence of memory stereotypes provides good opportunities for creativity.",
      1: "9 — “Basic intellect” — information is memorized according to the principle “repetition is the mother of learning.” The memory capacity is not very large, so one should not overload themselves with excessive knowledge — it will be forgotten anyway. However, in practice, they can quite normally operate with the knowledge they constantly work with.",
      2: "99 — “Bright mind” — any study or work with information comes very easily. This often leads to boredom and lack of motivation. It is simple for such a person to become an erudite and intellectual. But in reality, they should look for a truly interesting and profound subject to apply their mind to. The more complex it is, the greater the interest will be and, accordingly, the better the result.”",
      3: "999 — “Bright head” — any study or work with information comes very easily. This often causes boredom and lack of motivation. It is easy for such a person to be an erudite and an intellectual. But in reality, they should look for a truly interesting and profound subject to apply their mind. The more complex it is, the greater the interest will be and, accordingly, the better the result.”",
      4: "9999 — “Super-computer” — truth and the nature of knowledge are revealed to this person. School programs, higher mathematics, Chinese language, programming — for them, it is like cracking sunflower seeds. They can hold and process many processes in their mind at once. But for some reason, strong intellect is often accompanied by rudeness and disdain in communication with others. They consider their opinion to be the only true one. Example: Shakuntala Devi — a mathematical genius, a human computer, listed in the Guinness Book of Records.",
      5: "99999+ — “Super-intellect” — thanks to their extraordinary intelligence, this person can operate with colossal amounts of information. And the main thing that distinguishes the peak intellect of 99999 from the rest is the ability to tune into information channels, where they literally see and analyze all possible options. In communication, they are just as rough as the 9999 type. An extremely rare sign. Example: Alisher Usmanov."
