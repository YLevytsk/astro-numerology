      2: "“Normal” — self-esteem is neither low nor high. Strives to be like everyone else and is not at all embarrassed by it. Could achieve more on their own, but chooses to focus on the average level. Accordingly, they are not very fond of people with higher self-esteem.",
      3: "“Unstable” — in some areas, a person shows quite normal self-esteem. But in certain situations, they clearly overestimate their abilities, setting completely unrealistic goals. Then two paths follow: either the goal is abruptly abandoned, or, after it naturally fails to be achieved, someone else is blamed.",
      4: "“High” — does not want to be like everyone else, feels above others. Strives to achieve more, knowing they are worthy of it, and puts effort into reaching it. It should be noted that both high and overestimated self-esteem are strong incentives to achieve something in life.",
      5: "“Highest” — this kind of self-esteem makes it possible to pursue the boldest ambitions. Even if such a person sometimes overestimates themselves, they strive to live up to the standards they have set. It should be noted that high and inflated self-esteem is the most real incentive to achieve something in life.",
      6: "“Overestimated” — most often, a person evaluates themselves unreasonably high. They are also characterized by attitudes like “I deserve more,” and the like. In such a case, one must either work toward achieving what they believe they deserve or tone down their zeal. It should be noted that both high and overestimated self-esteem are strong incentives to achieve something in life. However, most such people eventually face a crisis when they look back over the years and realize they have not become who they wanted to be. At that moment, they either fall into deep depression or make a leap forward with renewed strength.",
      7: "“Overestimated” — most often, a person rates themselves unreasonably high. They also tend to hold positions like “I deserve more,” and so on. Well, in this case, one must either work toward achieving what they believe they deserve or temper their zeal. It should be noted that both high and overestimated self-esteem are the most real incentives to achieve something in life. However, most such people face a crisis at some point, when they look back from the height of their years and realize they have not become who they wanted to be.

      1: "“Not independent” — will do everything possible to remain under their parents’ wing for as long as they can. Later, they will look for a spouse capable of fully providing for the family. They don’t really know how to build wealth, so they may try many different ways at once but abandon them when they don’t bring the expected success.",
      2: "“Worrier” — the thought of needing to provide for themselves brings anxiety. On the one hand, if given the chance, they would be glad not to work at all. On the other hand, if necessity arises, they agree to work — as long as it pays.",
      3: "“Shift method” — the ideal way of financial support, in this person’s view: earn a living quickly and efficiently in a short time, and then relax. Most often, they look for piecework pay.",

      5: "“Financial genius” — in material terms, such a person can be relied upon 100%. They value work and value themselves, which is why they look for a place where they can earn well.

By the way, achieving goals is not among their favorite activities — they find it much more pleasant to dream of ruling the world than to actually conquer it. Sometimes they tend to overestimate themselves, first taking on something overwhelming and then abandoning it halfway.",
      4: "“Confident” — sets high, ambitious goals, evaluates the resources needed to achieve them, and usually follows through. It should be noted that strong determination is an important factor for success in life. In fact, such a person has even greater potential, but overly lofty goals may discourage them. Still, for the sake of challenge, they might attempt to reach them.",
      5: "“Stubborn” — goes toward their goal no matter the cost. They may even lose more than they gain, but they will still achieve it. They look for partners who also strive to get more out of life. At the same time, they look down on those whose goals seem insignificant to them. It should be noted that strong determination is an important factor for success in life.",
      6: "“Idealist” — sometimes chases openly unattainable goals, because others do not interest them. They spend a lot of energy, stumble, get disappointed, but then start all over again, believing that this time it will work out. Often, they become loners, since few are able to provide support on their difficult path.",

      2: "“Passive” — may even talk about planning a family, but takes little real action toward it. Would prefer to receive a proposal rather than make one themselves.",
      3: "“Spontaneous” — a person with this trait is often known to say they will never marry or that marriage is not for them. Yet one day you might suddenly receive a wedding invitation from them, after which they may turn out to be quite a good family person. And then, just as unexpectedly, file for divorce a year later.",
      4: "“Good family man” — for this sign, family values are not just empty words. They consciously plan to start a family and later prove themselves as a faithful family person. They seek a partner who shares this goal.",
      5: "“Family man–idealist” — envisions family and everything within it as a kind of ideal. Therefore, at first they carefully test their partner for perfection, and then, already in marriage, try to bring themselves, their partner, and the family relationship to that very ideal. Not every partner is ready to endure this.",
      6: "“Overly idealistic” — the search for a perfect partner to create a perfect family may last a lifetime because of its unattainability. Each attempt that does not bring them closer to this goal only upsets the bearer of this trait even more. In marriage, they will place excessive demands on their spouse.",

      5: "“Very stable” — habits and surroundings hardly ever change. They trust what they are used to. They may refuse to move away from the familiar, even if something new is better. Is this tediousness or predictability? One way or another, some people around them value it, while others find it irritating. Still, such a person is considered trustworthy.",
      6: "“Excess of habits” — a person becomes a slave to their own stability. They sometimes try to fight it, but mostly without success. One useless habit or attachment is replaced by another. For many close to them, they are extremely difficult to motivate or move.",

Others may seem overly preoccupied with it to them. But sometimes they themselves try to appear this way, following societal expectations — and end up engaging in casual relationships.",
      1: "“Cold” — a person with this trait does not mind physical love but is not preoccupied with it either. Such a person is often not too selective in partners and prone to infidelity, as they do it for self-assertion. Men with this temperament often want to appear as Don Juans in the eyes of friends and the opposite sex, exaggerating their romantic conquests.",
      2: "“Normal” — a normal temperament is compatible with most other temperaments. However, there is a tendency toward infidelity, as the bearer of this temperament is not fully confident in their own abilities and would like to assert themselves on the romantic front.",
      3: "“Impulsive” — this temperament can adapt to almost any partner: temper their passion with someone whose temperament is lower, and, on the contrary, be more passionate with someone whose temperament is higher. If they are temporarily without a partner, they may rush into casual relationships. Often, such a temperament tries to appear very passionate in the eyes of the opposite sex.",
      4: "“Warm” — the need for intimacy is strong for this temperament, so if they don’t have a partner, they put a lot of effort into finding one. However, the best matches for them are temperaments 3 and 5. With such partners, they truly open up, caring not only about their own satisfaction. They are considered fairly faithful.",
      5: "“Passionate” — this temperament cannot imagine life without physical love and requires it in abundance — for them, it is a form of self-expression. At the same time, it is important that their partner is equally passionate; only then will the exchange be complete. However, they do not pursue this for self-assertion, changing partners like gloves and boasting to friends about their conquests. On the contrary, passionate temperaments may even appear somewhat reserved on the outside. All their fire is revealed only with their partner.",
      6: "“Overheated” — a person with this temperament seems constantly dissatisfied, even right after leaving the bed. Sometimes they may even refuse intimacy altogether, losing all interest and showing outward coldness. At other times, on the contrary, in search of variety they lose both meaning and moderation. This is an unbalanced temperament that knows only extremes. Despite this, when they have a single partner, they are usually faithful.",
